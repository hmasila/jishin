# 1374. Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts

<br />Given an integer `n`, <em>return a string with `n` characters such that each character in such string occurs **an odd number of times**</em>.<br />
<br />The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return **any** of them.  <br />
<br /> <br />
<br />**Example 1:**<br />
```
Input: n = 4
Output: "pppz"
Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".
```
<br />**Example 2:**<br />
```
Input: n = 2
Output: "xy"
Explanation: "xy" is a valid string since the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".
```
<br />**Example 3:**<br />
```
Input: n = 7
Output: "holasss"
```
