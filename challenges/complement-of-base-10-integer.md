# 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer

<br />The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.<br />

* For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.


<br />Given an integer `n`, return <em>its complement</em>.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />**Example 1:**<br />
```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
```
<br />**Example 2:**<br />
```
Input: n = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
```
<br />**Example 3:**<br />
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
```
<br /> <br />
<br />**Constraints:**<br />

* `0 <;= n <; 10<sup>9</sup>`
