# 409. Longest Palindrome

<br />Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return <em>the length of the **longest palindrome**</em> that can be built with those letters.<br />
<br />Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />**Example 1:**<br />
```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```
<br />**Example 2:**<br />
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
```
<br /> <br />
<br />**Constraints:**<br />

* `1 <;= s.length <;= 2000`

* `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.
