# 1979. Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array

<br />Given an integer array `nums`, return** **<em>the **greatest common divisor** of the smallest number and largest number in </em>`nums`.<br />
<br />The **greatest common divisor** of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />**Example 1:**<br />
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 2.
The largest number in nums is 10.
The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
```
<br />**Example 2:**<br />
```
Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 8.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
```
<br />**Example 3:**<br />
```
Input: nums = [3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 3.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.
```

<br />**Constraints:**<br />

* `2 <;= nums.length <;= 1000`

* `1 <;= nums[i] <;= 1000`
